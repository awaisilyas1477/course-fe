      Our Story
    </h3>

    <p className="mt-4 text-black font-BearFont-regular text-[16px] leading-[22px] tracking-tight">
      Our e-learning platform was founded in 2017, driven by a passion for education and technology. Initially, the platform started as a small venture, with the founder juggling various projects while trying to make quality education more accessible online. The journey began as a passion project rather than a formal business, with the platform name visible only on personal social media profiles.

      The Humble Beginnings: 2017-2018
    </p>

    <p className="mt-4 text-black font-BearFont-regular text-[16px] leading-[22px] tracking-tight">
      In the early days, the e-learning platform operated without any official paperwork, focusing on delivering online courses and educational resources. Despite the slow growth initially, the dedication to providing value remained strong. The first year posed challenges as balancing multiple activities left limited time for growth, but it was key to laying the foundation for future success.

      Scaling New Heights: 2020-2021
    </p>

    <p className="mt-4 text-black font-BearFont-regular text-[16px] leading-[22px] tracking-tight">
      Originally operating remotely, the platform transitioned into a more structured environment pre-pandemic, which helped foster better collaboration. However, the onset of COVID-19 in 2020 forced a rapid transition to a fully remote setup. This shift tested our resilience but also showcased our commitment to the mission of providing education worldwide. The remote approach contributed to massive growth, as the demand for e-learning surged globally.

    <p className="mt-4 text-black font-BearFont-regular text-[16px] leading-[22px] tracking-tight">
      During this period, our team worked tirelessly to build new courses and refine the platform. Despite the challenges, the demand for e-learning exploded, and we expanded our offerings to include advanced courses, certification programs, and corporate training. The dedication to delivering top-notch education online ensured that our platform not only survived but thrived during the pandemic.

      Embracing Hybrid Learning and Global Expansion
    </p>

    <p className="mt-4 text-black font-BearFont-regular text-[16px] leading-[22px] tracking-tight">
      In 2021, we embraced a hybrid learning model, offering learners the choice to engage with content online or in person. This flexible approach improved accessibility and engagement, enabling learners to choose their preferred method of learning. The hybrid model boosted productivity and morale, allowing users to adapt to their own pace and environment.
